A Rescue Ambulance and Rescue Engine were dispatched to the area of Rockford Hills from Station 7 and Station 3 for an Officer-involved MVA. After arriving on-scene, the medical crew and firefighters quickly identified three casualties, two being officers and one being a civilian. After providing on-scene medical aid to all of them and ensuring that none of the vehicles were a fire hazard, the two officers were transported to the hospital and the civilian casualty was let go without any need of transportation to the hospital.
