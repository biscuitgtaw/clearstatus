An Engine, Rescue Ambulance and Search and Rescue were dispatched out to the area of Textile City from Station 3, Station 7 and Station 1 for a person stuck on the roof. Once arriving on scene, the rescue units quickly identified a singular casualty and proceeded to start the rescue operation attempting to extract them off the roof to safety. They were extracted successfully and after a quick medical check were deemed in a well enough condition to not need a trip to the hospital.
