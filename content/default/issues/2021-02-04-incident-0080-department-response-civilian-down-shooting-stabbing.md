A Rescue Basic and Rescue Ambulance were dispatched from Station 7 to assist with a Civilian down from stab and gun shot wounds. After arriving on scene the medical crew identified a singular casualty and applied medical aid to them. (( An admin voided the scene afterwards due to the person being AFK. ))

Responding Units: RB-71, RA-72
