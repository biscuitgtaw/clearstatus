A Rescue Engine, Engine, Two Rescue Ambulances, Deputy Chief, Ladder Truck, State Fire Marshals, Search and Rescue and Public Information Officer were dispatched from Station 7, Station 3, Station 6 and HQ to assist with a structure fire in the area of Mirror Park. After arriving on scene, the units confirmed a fully ablaze structure fire and started an exterior attack as well as a primary search. The primary search team were caught out by a flashover due to a lack of ventilation and declared a mayday, a Rapid Intervention Crew was dispatched to extract the firefighters out of the building. Afterwards, the firefighters were rescued and there was no loss of life confirmed as a result of the fire. The firefighters suffered from second degree burns as a result of being caught within the blaze of the flashover but were rescued out of the building just before the other flashover occurred. Afterwards, ventilation was established and firefighters resumed their Primary Attack and Search with a full knockdown being established at 21:19.
