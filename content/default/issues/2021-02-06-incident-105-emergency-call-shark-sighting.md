A Rescue Ambulance, Three Rescue Boats, Two Lifeguard Patrols and a Helicopter were dispatched from Tower 2, Station 7 and Station 3 to assist with a shark sighting. After responding to the area the Rescue Crew tried to locate the caller only to find an empty vessel, a Search and Rescue operation was then called to attempt to locate the caller. As the incident hit the 20 minute mark, a firefighter in distress call came in with one of the divers that had difficulties bringing themselves back to surface and a triage call had been declared, but shortly afterwards, was also cancelled. No firefighters were harmed and no one was found during the search.

Responding Units: COPTER-2, LP-3, LP-1, SWR-3, SWR-2, RA-72, RWC-1, RWC-2, RRD-1
